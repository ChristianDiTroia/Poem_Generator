      "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since\n",
      "‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had\n",
      "’He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that\n",
      "In consequence I’m in -clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores\n",
      "The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men\n",
      "Most of the con -fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver -ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions\n",
      "Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope\n",
      "I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my fa -\n",
      "ther snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth\n",
      "And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit\n",
      "Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on\n",
      "When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want -ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart\n",
      "Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffect -ed scorn\n",
      "If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away\n",
      "This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again\n",
      "No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men\n",
      "My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations\n",
      "The Car -\n",
      "raways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the ac -tual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father car -ries on today\n",
      "I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father’s office\n",
      "I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic mi -gration known as the Great War\n",
      "I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless\n",
      "Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and learn the bond business\n",
      "Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man\n",
      "All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—ye-es’ with very grave, hesitant faces\n",
      "Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came east, perma -nently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two\n",
      "The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office sug -gested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea\n",
      "He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went\n",
      "out to the country alone\n",
      "I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut -tered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove\n",
      "It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road\n",
      "‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helpless -ly\n",
      "I told him\n",
      "And as I walked on I was lonely no longer\n",
      "I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler\n",
      "He had casu -ally conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood\n",
      "And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer\n",
      "There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giv -ing air\n",
      "I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Mae -cenas knew\n",
      "And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides\n",
      "I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man\n",
      "’ This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all\n",

      "It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North Ameri -ca\n",
      "It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land\n",
      "Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound\n",
      "They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead\n",
      "To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size\n",
      "I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bi -zarre and not a little sinister contrast between them\n",
      "My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season\n",
      "The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imi -tation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden\n",
      "It was Gatsby’s mansion\n",
      "Or rather, as I didn’t know Mr\n",
      "Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentle -man of that name\n",
      "My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a\n",
      "view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dol -lars a month\n",
      "Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans\n",
      "Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college\n",
      "And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago\n",
      "Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-cli -max\n",
      "His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest\n",
      "It was hard to real -ize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that\n",
      "Why they came east I don’t know\n",
      "They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together\n",
      "This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seek -ing a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarce -ly knew at all\n",
      "Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial man -sion overlooking the bay\n",
      "The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—final -ly when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run\n",
      "The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch\n",
      "He had changed since his New Haven years\n",
      "Now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner\n",
      "Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward\n",
      "Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat\n",
      "It was a body capable of enor -mous leverage—a cruel body\n",
      "His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the im -pression of fractiousness he conveyed\n",
      "There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts\n",
      "‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’\n",
      "10he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are\n",
      "’ We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own\n",
      "We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch\n",
      "‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly\n",
      "Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore\n",
      "‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man\n",
      "’ He turned me around again, politely and abruptly\n",
      "‘We’ll go inside\n",
      "’We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end\n",
      "The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house\n",
      "A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, mak -ing a shadow on it as wind does on the sea\n",
      "The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon\n",
      "They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house\n",
      "I must have stood for a few moments listening to\n",
      "11 the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a pic -ture on the wall\n",
      "Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor\n",
      "The younger of the two was a stranger to me\n",
      "She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall\n",
      "If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apol -ogy for having disturbed her by coming in\n",
      "The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room\n",
      "‘I’m p-paralyzed with happiness\n",
      "’She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see\n",
      "That was a way she had\n",
      "She hinted in a mur -mur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker\n",
      "(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming\n",
      ")At any rate Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright\n",
      "Again a sort of\n",
      "1apology arose to my lips\n",
      "Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me\n",
      "I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me ques -tions in her low, thrilling voice\n",
      "It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrange -ment of notes that will never be played again\n",
      "Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth—but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ‘Listen,’ a prom -ise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour\n",
      "I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me\n",
      "‘Do they miss me?’ she cried ecstatically\n",
      "‘The whole town is desolate\n",
      "All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there’s a per -sistent wail all night along the North Shore\n",
      "’‘How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom\n",
      "Tomorrow!’ Then she added irrelevantly, ‘You ought to see the baby\n",
      "’‘I’d like to\n",
      "’‘She’s asleep\n",
      "She’s two years old\n",
      "Haven’t you ever seen her?’‘Never\n",
      "’‘Well, you ought to see her\n",
      "She’s——‘Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ‘What you doing, Nick?’‘I’m a bond man\n",
      "’‘Who with?’I told him\n",
      "‘Never heard of them,’ he remarked decisively\n",
      "This annoyed me\n",
      "‘You will,’ I answered shortly\n",
      "‘You will if you stay in the East\n",
      "’‘Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,’ he said, glanc -ing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more\n",
      "‘I’d be a God Damned fool to live any -where else\n",
      "’At this point Miss Baker said ‘Absolutely!’ with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room\n",
      "Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room\n",
      "‘I’m stiff,’ she complained, ‘I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember\n",
      "’‘Don’t look at me,’ Daisy retorted\n",
      "‘I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon\n",
      "’‘No, thanks,’ said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, ‘I’m absolutely in training\n",
      "’Her host looked at her incredulously\n",
      "‘You are!’ He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass\n",
      "‘How you ever get anything done is beyond me\n",
      "’I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she ‘got done\n",
      "’ I enjoyed looking at her\n",
      "She was a slender, small-\n",
      "1breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet\n",
      "Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discon -tented face\n",
      "It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before\n",
      "‘You live in West Egg,’ she remarked contemptuously\n",
      "‘I know somebody there\n",
      "’‘I don’t know a single——‘‘You must know Gatsby\n",
      "’‘Gatsby?’ demanded Daisy\n",
      "‘What Gatsby?’Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively un -der mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square\n",
      "Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind\n",
      "‘Why CANDLES?’ objected Daisy, frowning\n",
      "She snapped them out with her fingers\n",
      "‘In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year\n",
      "’ She looked at us all radiantly\n",
      "‘Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it\n",
      "’‘We ought to plan something,’ yawned Miss Baker, sit -ting down at the table as if she were getting into bed\n",
      "‘All right,’ said Daisy\n",
      "‘What’ll we plan?’ She turned to me helplessly\n",
      "‘What do people plan?’\n",
      "1 Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed ex -pression on her little finger\n",
      "‘Look!’ she complained\n",
      "‘I hurt it\n",
      "’We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue\n",

      "’‘Hulking,’ insisted Daisy\n",
      "Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtru -sively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire\n",
      "They were here—and they accepted Tom and me, making only a po -lite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained\n",
      "They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away\n",
      "It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hur -ried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself\n",
      "‘You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,’ I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret\n",
      "‘Can’t you talk about crops or something?’I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way\n",

      "Have you read ‘The Rise of the Coloured Empires’ by this man God -dard?’‘Why, no,’ I answered, rather surprised by his tone\n",
      "‘Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it\n",
      "The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be ut -terly submerged\n",
      "It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved\n",

      "Do you see?’There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more\n",
      "When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me\n",

      "Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position\n",
      "’For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affec -tion upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk\n",
      "The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside\n",
      "As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing\n",

      "A subdued im -passioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear\n",
      "The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether\n",

      "‘You mean to say you don’t know?’ said Miss Baker, hon -estly surprised\n",
      "‘I thought everybody knew\n",
      "’‘I don’t\n",
      "’‘Why——’ she said hesitantly, ‘Tom’s got some woman in New York\n",
      "’‘Got some woman?’ I repeated blankly\n",
      "Miss Baker nodded\n",
      "‘She might have the decency not to telephone him at din -ner-time\n",
      "Don’t you think?’Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table\n",
      "‘It couldn’t be helped!’ cried Daisy with tense gayety\n",
      "She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: ‘I looked outdoors for a minute and it’s very romantic outdoors\n",
      "There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard\n",
      "1 or White Star Line\n",
      "He’s singing away——’ her voice sang ‘——It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?’‘Very romantic,’ he said, and then miserably to me: ‘If it’s light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables\n",
      "’The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air\n",
      "Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes\n",
      "I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill me -tallic urgency out of mind\n",
      "To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police\n",
      "The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again\n",
      "Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly in -terested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front\n",
      "In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee\n",
      "Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its love -ly shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk\n",
      "I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl\n",

      "’‘I wasn’t back from the war\n",
      "’‘That’s true\n",
      "’ She hesitated\n",
      "‘Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything\n",
      "’Evidently she had reason to be\n",
      "I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter\n",
      "‘I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything\n",
      "’‘Oh, yes\n",
      "’ She looked at me absently\n",
      "‘Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born\n",
      "Would you like to hear?’‘Very much\n",
      "’‘It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things\n",
      "Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where\n",
      "I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl\n",
      "She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept\n",
      "‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl\n",
      "And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool\n",
      "’‘You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,’ she went on in a convinced way\n",
      "‘Everybody thinks so—the most ad -vanced people\n",
      "And I KNOW\n",
      "I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything\n",

      "1 attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said\n",
      "It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emo -tion from me\n",
      "I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged\n",
      "Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light\n",
      "Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the ‘Saturday Evening Post’—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a sooth -ing tune\n",
      "The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms\n",
      "When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand\n",
      "‘To be continued,’ she said, tossing the magazine on the table, ‘in our very next issue\n",
      "’Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up\n",
      "‘Ten o’clock,’ she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling\n",
      "‘Time for this good girl to go to bed\n",
      "’‘Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,’ ex -plained Daisy, ‘over at Westchester\n",

      "You know—lock you up acci -dentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing——‘‘Good night,’ called Miss Baker from the stairs\n",

      "‘I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race\n",
      "Yes, I’m sure we did\n",
      "It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know——‘‘Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,’ he advised me\n",
      "I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home\n",
      "They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light\n",

      "’Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged\n",
      "The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come east\n",
      "You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage\n",
      "Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little dis -gusted as I drove away\n",
      "It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head\n",
      "As for Tom, the fact that he ‘had some woman in New York’ was\n",
      "really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book\n",
      "Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart\n",
      "Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard\n",
      "The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life\n",
      "The silhouette of a moving cat wa -vered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars\n",

      "Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction\n",
      "But I didn’t call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling\n",
      "Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock\n",

      "About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land\n",
      "This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen -dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air\n",
      "Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight\n",
      "But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T\n",

      "There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress\n",
      "The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known\n",
      "His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew\n",
      "Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet her—but I did\n",
      "I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car\n",

      "The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing\n",

      "The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car vis -ible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner\n",
      "It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste\n",
      "He was a blonde, spiritless man, anae -mic, and faintly handsome\n",
      "When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes\n",
      "‘Hello, Wilson, old man,’ said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder\n",
      "‘How’s business?’‘I can’t complain,’ answered Wilson unconvincingly\n",

      "Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a mo -ment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door\n",
      "She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can\n",
      "Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty\n",
      "but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering\n",
      "She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye\n",
      "Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:‘Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down\n",
      "’‘Oh, sure,’ agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls\n",
      "A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom\n",
      "‘I want to see you,’ said Tom intently\n",

      "Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train\n",
      "She had changed her dress to a brown figured mus -lin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York\n",
      "At the news-stand she bought a copy of ‘Town Tattle’ and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream and a small flask of perfume\n",
      "Upstairs, in the solemn echo -ing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glow -ing sunshine\n",
      "But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass\n",

      "‘No, it’s not exactly a polICE dog,’ said the man with disappointment in his voice\n",

      "With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change\n",
      "The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was con -verted into impressive hauteur\n",

      "As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his where -abouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone\n",

      "There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree\n",
      "Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the country -side—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety\n",

      "There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing young girls backward in eternal grace -less circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the corners—and a great num -ber of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps\n",
      "By midnight the hilarity had increased\n",
      "A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing ‘stunts’ all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky\n",
      "A pair of stage ‘twins’—who turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act in cos -tume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls\n",
      "The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn\n",
      "I was still with Jordan Baker\n",
      "We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laugh -ter\n",

      "I had taken two finger bowls\n",
      "of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound\n",

      "I’m afraid I’m not a very good host\n",
      "’He smiled understandingly—much more than under -standingly\n",
      "It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life\n",
      "It faced—or seemed to face—the whole ex -ternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor\n",
      "It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey\n",
      "Precisely at that point it van -ished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd\n",
      "Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care\n",
      "Almost at the moment when Mr\n",

      "He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn\n",

      "’When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise\n",
      "I had expected that Mr\n",
      "Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years\n",

      "’\n",
      "‘Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?’‘Now YOU’re started on the subject,’ she answered with a wan smile\n",
      "‘Well,—he told me once he was an Oxford man\n",
      "’A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away\n",
      "‘However, I don’t believe it\n",
      "’‘Why not?’‘I don’t know,’ she insisted, ‘I just don’t think he went there\n",
      "’Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s ‘I think he killed a man,’ and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity\n",
      "I would have accepted without question the infor -mation that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York\n",
      "That was compre -hensible\n",
      "But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of no -where and buy a palace on Long Island Sound\n",
      "‘Anyhow he gives large parties,’ said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete\n",
      "‘And I like large parties\n",
      "They’re so intimate\n",
      "At small parties there isn’t any privacy\n",
      "’There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden\n",

      "’ ‘The nature of Mr\n",
      "Tostoff’s composition eluded me, be -cause just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes\n",
      "His tanned skin was drawn attractive -ly tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day\n",
      "I could see nothing sinister about him\n",
      "I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased\n",
      "When the ‘Jazz History of the World’ was over girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups knowing that some one would ar -rest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder and no sing -ing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link\n",
      "‘I beg your pardon\n",

      "‘Yes, madame\n",
      "’She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in aston -ishment, and followed the butler toward the house\n",
      "I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports\n",
      "clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings\n",
      "I was alone and it was almost two\n",
      "For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-win -dowed room which overhung the terrace\n",
      "Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical con -versation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside\n",
      "The large room was full of people\n",
      "One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song\n",
      "She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that every -thing was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too\n",
      "Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyr -ic again in a quavering soprano\n",
      "The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets\n",
      "A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep\n",
      "‘She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,’ explained a girl at my elbow\n",
      "I looked around\n",
      "Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands\n",

      "der by dissension\n",
      "One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempt -ing to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed ‘You promised!’ into his ear\n",
      "The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men\n",
      "The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably so -ber men and their highly indignant wives\n",
      "The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices\n",
      "‘Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home\n",

      "As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together\n",
      "He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye\n",
      "Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands\n",
      "‘I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,’ she whispered\n",

      "‘Why,—about an hour\n",
      "’‘It was—simply amazing,’ she repeated abstractedly\n",

      "Under the name of Mrs\n",
      "Sigourney How -ard…\n",
      "My aunt…\n",
      "’ She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door\n",
      "Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests who were clus -tered around him\n",
      "I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden\n",
      "‘Don’t mention it,’ he enjoined me eagerly\n",
      "‘Don’t give it another thought, old sport\n",
      "’ The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder\n",

      "Good night\n",
      "’But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over\n",
      "Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights\n",
      "illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene\n",
      "In the ditch be -side the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before\n",
      "The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the de -tachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs\n",
      "However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene\n",
      "A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleas -ant, puzzled way\n",
      "‘See!’ he explained\n",
      "‘It went in the ditch\n",
      "’The fact was infinitely astonishing to him—and I rec -ognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library\n",
      "‘How’d it happen?’He shrugged his shoulders\n",
      "‘I know nothing whatever about mechanics,’ he said de -cisively\n",
      "‘But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?’‘Don’t ask me,’ said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter\n",
      "‘I know very little about driving—next to nothing\n",
      "It happened, and that’s all I know\n",
      "’‘Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night\n",
      "’‘But I wasn’t even trying,’ he explained indignantly, ‘I wasn’t even trying\n",
      "’\n",
      "0An awed hush fell upon the bystanders\n",
      "‘Do you want to commit suicide?’‘You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!’‘You don’t understand,’ explained the criminal\n",
      "‘I wasn’t driving\n",
      "There’s another man in the car\n",
      "’The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ‘Ah-h-h!’ as the door of the coupé swung slowly open\n",
      "The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back in -voluntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause\n",
      "Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tenta -tively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe\n",
      "Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster\n",
      "‘Wha’s matter?’ he inquired calmly\n",
      "‘Did we run outa gas?’‘Look!’Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky\n",
      "‘It came off,’ some one explained\n",
      "He nodded\n",
      "‘At first I din’ notice we’d stopped\n",
      "’A pause\n",
      "Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice:‘Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?’\n",
      "1 At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond\n",
      "‘Back out,’ he suggested after a moment\n",
      "‘Put her in re -verse\n",
      "’‘But the WHEEL’S off!’He hesitated\n",
      "‘No harm in trying,’ he said\n",
      "The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home\n",
      "I glanced back once\n",
      "A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden\n",
      "A sud -den emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the fig -ure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell\n",
      "Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me\n",
      "On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal af -fairs\n",
      "Most of the time I worked\n",
      "In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust\n",
      "I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee\n",
      "I even\n",
      "had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother be -gan throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away\n",
      "I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went up -stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour\n",
      "There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work\n",
      "After that, if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station\n",
      "I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye\n",
      "I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic wom -en from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove\n",
      "Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness\n",
      "At the enchanted metropoli -tan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poi -gnant moments of night and life\n",
      "Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the For -ties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the\n",

      "Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted ciga -rettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside\n",
      "Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well\n",
      "For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in mid -summer I found her again\n",
      "At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and ev -ery one knew her name\n",
      "Then it was something more\n",
      "I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity\n",
      "The bored haughty face that she turned to the world con -cealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was\n",
      "When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s\n",
      "At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a sug -gestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round\n",
      "The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away\n",
      "A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken\n",

      "She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness I sup -pose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body\n",
      "It made no difference to me\n",
      "Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot\n",
      "It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car\n",

      "I rushed out and found her mother’s maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath\n",
      "She wouldn’t let go of the letter\n",
      "She\n",
      "took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow\n",
      "But she didn’t say another word\n",
      "We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over\n",
      "Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchan -an without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas\n",
      "I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband\n",
      "If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily and say ‘Where’s Tom gone?’ and wear the most abstract -ed expression until she saw him coming in the door\n",
      "She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight\n",
      "It was touching to see them togeth -er—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way\n",
      "That was in August\n",
      "A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car\n",
      "The girl who was with him got into the pa -pers too because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel\n",
      "The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year\n",
      "I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down\n",
      "Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know\n",
      "They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and\n",
      "wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation\n",
      "Perhaps because she doesn’t drink\n",
      "It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people\n",
      "You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregulari -ty of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care\n",
      "Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…\n",
      "Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years\n",
      "It was when I asked you—do you re -member?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg\n",
      "After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said ‘What Gatsby?’ and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know\n",
      "It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car\n",
      "When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park\n",
      "The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:‘I’m the Sheik of Araby,  Your love belongs to me\n",
      "At night when you’re are asleep,  Into your tent I’ll creep——’ ‘It was a strange coincidence,’ I said\n",
      "‘But it wasn’t a coincidence at all\n",
      "’\n",
      "‘Why not?’‘Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay\n",
      "’Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night\n",
      "He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor\n",
      "‘He wants to know—’ continued Jordan ‘—if you’ll in -vite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over\n",
      "’The modesty of the demand shook me\n",
      "He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed star -light to casual moths so that he could ‘come over’ some afternoon to a stranger’s garden\n",
      "‘Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?’‘He’s afraid\n",
      "He’s waited so long\n",
      "He thought you might be offended\n",
      "You see he’s a regular tough underneath it all\n",
      "’Something worried me\n",
      "‘Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?’‘He wants her to see his house,’ she explained\n",
      "‘And your house is right next door\n",
      "’‘Oh!’‘I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,’ went on Jordan, ‘but she never did\n",
      "Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found\n",
      "It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it\n",
      "Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:\n",
      "’ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept say -ing\n",
      "‘I want to see her right next door\n",
      "’‘When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s he started to abandon the whole idea\n",
      "He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name\n",
      "’It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner\n",
      "Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm\n",
      "A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excite -ment: ‘There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired\n",
      "’‘And Daisy ought to have something in her life,’ mur -mured Jordan to me\n",
      "‘Does she want to see Gatsby?’‘She’s not to know about it\n",
      "Gatsby doesn’t want her to know\n",
      "You’re just supposed to invite her to tea\n",
      "’We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park\n",
      "Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms\n",
      "Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire\n",
      "Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongat -ing glints upon the roadside wires\n",
      "Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar\n",
      "At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into ‘hide-and-go-seek’ or ‘sardines-in-the-box’ with all the house thrown open to the game\n",
      "But there wasn’t a sound\n",
      "Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness\n",
      "As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn\n",
      "‘Your place looks like the world’s fair,’ I said\n",
      "‘Does it?’ He turned his eyes toward it absently\n",
      "‘I have been glancing into some of the rooms\n",
      "Let’s go to Coney Is -land, old sport\n",
      "In my car\n",
      "’‘It’s too late\n",
      "’‘Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer\n",
      "’‘I’ve got to go to bed\n",
      "’‘All right\n",
      "’He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness\n",
      "‘I talked with Miss Baker,’ I said after a moment\n",
      "‘I’m go -\n",
      "ing to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea\n",
      "’‘Oh, that’s all right,’ he said carelessly\n",
      "‘I don’t want to put you to any trouble\n",
      "’‘What day would suit you?’‘What day would suit YOU?’ he corrected me quickly\n",
      "‘I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see\n",
      "’‘How about the day after tomorrow?’ He considered for a moment\n",
      "Then, with reluctance:‘I want to get the grass cut,’ he said\n",
      "We both looked at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept ex -panse of his began\n",
      "I suspected that he meant my grass\n",
      "‘There’s another little thing,’ he said uncertainly, and hesitated\n",
      "‘Would you rather put it off for a few days?’ I asked\n",
      "‘Oh, it isn’t about that\n",
      "At least——’ He fumbled with a series of beginnings\n",
      "‘Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?’‘Not very much\n",
      "’This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently\n",
      "‘I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand\n",
      "And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?’‘Trying to\n",
      "’‘Well, this would interest you\n",
      "It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money\n",
      "It\n",
      "happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing\n",
      "’I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life\n",
      "But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a ser -vice to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off  there\n",
      "‘I’ve got my hands full,’ I said\n",
      "‘I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work\n",
      "’‘You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem\n",
      "’ Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the ‘gon -negtion’ mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong\n",
      "He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a con -versation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home\n",
      "The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door\n",
      "So I didn’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Is -land or for how many hours he ‘glanced into rooms’ while his house blazed gaudily on\n",
      "I called up Daisy from the of -fice next morning and invited her to come to tea\n",
      "‘Don’t bring Tom,’ I warned her\n",
      "‘What?’‘Don’t bring Tom\n",
      "’‘Who is ‘Tom’?’ she asked innocently\n",
      "The day agreed upon was pouring rain\n",
      "At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that Mr\n",
      "Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass\n",
      "This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to\n",
      "0search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers\n",
      "The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a green -house arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it\n",
      "An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-col -ored tie hurried in\n",
      "He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes\n",
      "‘Is everything all right?’ he asked immediately\n",
      "‘The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean\n",
      "’‘What grass?’ he inquired blankly\n",
      "‘Oh, the grass in the yard\n",
      "’ He looked out the window at it, but judging from his expression I don’t believe he saw a thing\n",
      "‘Looks very good,’ he remarked vaguely\n",
      "‘One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four\n",
      "I think it was ‘The Journal\n",
      "’ Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?’I took him into the pantry where he looked a little re -proachfully at the Finn\n",
      "Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop\n",
      "‘Will they do?’ I asked\n",
      "‘Of course, of course! They’re fine!’ and he added hol -lowly, ‘…old sport\n",
      "’The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew\n",
      "Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s ‘Econom -ics,’ starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were\n",
      "1 taking place outside\n",
      "Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home\n",
      "‘Why’s that?’‘Nobody’s coming to tea\n",
      "It’s too late!’ He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere\n",
      "‘I can’t wait all day\n",
      "’‘Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four\n",
      "’He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and si -multaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane\n",
      "We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard\n",
      "Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive\n",
      "It stopped\n",
      "Daisy’s face, tipped side -ways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile\n",
      "‘Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?’The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain\n",
      "I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through\n",
      "A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car\n",
      "‘Are you in love with me,’ she said low in my ear\n",
      "‘Or why did I have to come alone?’‘That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent\n",
      "Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour\n",
      "’‘Come back in an hour, Ferdie\n",
      "’ Then in a grave murmur, ‘His name is Ferdie\n",
      "’‘Does the gasoline affect his nose?’\n",
      "‘I don’t think so,’ she said innocently\n",
      "‘Why?’We went in\n",
      "To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted\n",
      "‘Well, that’s funny!’ I exclaimed\n",
      "‘What’s funny?’She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knock -ing at the front door\n",
      "I went out and opened it\n",
      "Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragi -cally into my eyes\n",
      "With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and dis -appeared into the living room\n",
      "It wasn’t a bit funny\n",
      "Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain\n",
      "For half a minute there wasn’t a sound\n",
      "Then from the living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note\n",
      "‘I certainly am awfully glad to see you again\n",
      "’A pause; it endured horribly\n",
      "I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room\n",
      "Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom\n",
      "His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair\n",
      "‘We’ve met before,’ muttered Gatsby\n",
      "His eyes glanced\n",
      "momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh\n",
      "Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place\n",
      "Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand\n",
      "‘I’m sorry about the clock,’ he said\n",
      "My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn\n",
      "I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thou -sand in my head\n",
      "‘It’s an old clock,’ I told them idiotically\n",
      "I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor\n",
      "‘We haven’t met for many years,’ said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be\n",
      "‘Five years next November\n",
      "’The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute\n",
      "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray\n",
      "Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a cer -tain physical decency established itself\n",
      "Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked consci -entiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes\n",
      "However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet\n",
      "‘Where are you going?’ demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm\n",
      "‘I’ll be back\n",
      "’\n",
      "‘I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go\n",
      "’He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: ‘Oh, God!’ in a miserable way\n",
      "‘What’s the matter?’‘This is a terrible mistake,’ he said, shaking his head from side to side, ‘a terrible, terrible mistake\n",
      "’‘You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,’ and luckily I added: ‘Daisy’s embarrassed too\n",
      "’‘She’s embarrassed?’ he repeated incredulously\n",
      "‘Just as much as you are\n",
      "’‘Don’t talk so loud\n",
      "’‘You’re acting like a little boy,’ I broke out impatiently\n",
      "‘Not only that but you’re rude\n",
      "Daisy’s sitting in there all alone\n",
      "’He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room\n",
      "I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour be -fore—and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain\n",
      "Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehis -toric marshes\n",
      "There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour\n",
      "A brewer had built it early in the ‘period’ craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have\n",
      "their roofs thatched with straw\n",
      "Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline\n",
      "His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door\n",
      "Americans, while occasion -ally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry\n",
      "After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoon -ful\n",
      "A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden\n",
      "It was time I went back\n",
      "While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and the, with gusts of emotion\n",
      "But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too\n",
      "I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitch -en short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound\n",
      "They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone\n",
      "Daisy’s face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her hand -kerchief before a mirror\n",
      "But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding\n",
      "He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room\n",
      "‘Oh, hello, old sport,’ he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years\n",
      "I thought for a moment he was going to shake\n",
      "hands\n",
      "‘It’s stopped raining\n",
      "’‘Has it?’ When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy\n",
      "‘What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining\n",
      "’‘I’m glad, Jay\n",
      "’ Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy\n",
      "‘I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,’ he said, ‘I’d like to show her around\n",
      "’‘You’re sure you want me to come?’‘Absolutely, old sport\n",
      "’Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn\n",
      "‘My house looks well, doesn’t it?’ he demanded\n",
      "‘See how the whole front of it catches the light\n",
      "’I agreed that it was splendid\n",
      "‘Yes\n",
      "’ His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower\n",
      "‘It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it\n",
      "’‘I thought you inherited your money\n",
      "’‘I did, old sport,’ he said automatically, ‘but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war\n",
      "’I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered ‘That’s my affair,’ before he realized that it wasn’t the appropriate re -ply\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, I’ve been in several things,’ he corrected himself\n",
      "‘I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business\n",
      "But I’m not in either one now\n",
      "’ He looked at me with more attention\n",
      "‘Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?’Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sun -light\n",
      "‘That huge place THERE?’ she cried pointing\n",
      "‘Do you like it?’‘I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone\n",
      "’‘I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day\n",
      "People who do interesting things\n",
      "Celebrated people\n",
      "’Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern\n",
      "With en -chanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate\n",
      "It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees\n",
      "And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under or -ders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through\n",
      "As Gatsby closed the door of ‘the Merton College Library’ I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter\n",
      "\n",
      "We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunk -en baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor\n",
      "It was Mr\n",
      "Klipspringer, the ‘boarder\n",
      "’ I had seen him wander -ing hungrily about the beach that morning\n",
      "Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall\n",
      "He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes\n",
      "Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real\n",
      "Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs\n",
      "His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold\n",
      "Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh\n",

      "an inconceivable pitch of intensity\n",
      "Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock\n",
      "Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high\n",
      "‘I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes\n",
      "He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall\n",
      "’He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the ta -ble in many-colored disarray\n",
      "While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue\n",
      "Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily\n",
      "‘They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muf -fled in the thick folds\n",
      "‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before\n",
      "’After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound\n",
      "‘If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,’ said Gatsby\n",
      "‘You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock\n",

      "100Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said\n",
      "Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever\n",
      "Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her\n",
      "It had seemed as close as a star to the moon\n",
      "Now it was again a green light on a dock\n",
      "His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one\n",

      "’I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone\n",

      "In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano\n",
      "He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall\n",
      "When Klipspringer had played ‘The Love Nest’ he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom\n",

      "IN THE MEANTIME,\n",
      "10 IN BETWEEN TIME—— As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness\n",
      "Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion\n",
      "It had gone beyond her, beyond everything\n",
      "He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way\n",
      "No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart\n",
      "As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly\n",
      "His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion\n",
      "I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song\n",
      "They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all\n",
      "I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life\n",

      "10About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say\n",
      "‘Anything to say about what?’ inquired Gatsby politely\n",
      "‘Why,—any statement to give out\n",
      "’It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand\n",
      "This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hur -ried out ‘to see\n",
      "’It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right\n",
      "Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news\n",
      "Contemporary legends such as the ‘under -ground pipe-line to Canada’ attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore\n",
      "Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say\n",
      "James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name\n",
      "He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when\n",
      "10 he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidi -ous flat on Lake Superior\n",
      "It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jer -sey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour\n",
      "I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then\n",
      "His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peo -ple—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all\n",
      "The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself\n",
      "He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretri -cious beauty\n",
      "So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end\n",
      "For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed\n",
      "His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days\n",
      "He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became con -temptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted\n",
      "But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot\n",
      "The most\n",
      "10grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night\n",
      "A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor\n",
      "Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies un -til drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace\n",
      "For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing\n",
      "An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St\n",
      "Olaf in southern Minnesota\n",
      "He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through\n",
      "Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shal -lows along shore\n",
      "Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Sev -enty-five\n",
      "The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money\n",
      "The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Main -tenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902\n",
      "He\n",
      "10 had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny at Little Girl Bay\n",
      "To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world\n",
      "I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled\n",
      "At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and extravagantly ambitious\n",
      "A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap\n",
      "And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left  too\n",
      "He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skip -per, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby\n",
      "The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the con -tinent\n",
      "It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died\n",
      "I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard empty face—the pioneer de -bauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the fron -tier brothel and saloon\n",
      "It was indirectly due to Cody that\n",
      "10Gatsby drank so little\n",
      "Sometimes in the course of gay par -ties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone\n",
      "And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars\n",
      "He didn’t get it\n",
      "He nev -er understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye\n",
      "He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substanti -ality of a man\n",
      "He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true\n",
      "Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him\n",
      "So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away\n",
      "It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs\n",
      "For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon\n",
      "I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink\n",
      "I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened be -fore\n",

      "’He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there\n",
      "But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for\n",
      "Mr\n",
      "Sloane wanted nothing\n",
      "A lemonade? No, thanks\n",
      "A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks…\n",

      "’‘I suppose the automobiles——‘‘Yeah\n",

      "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party\n",
      "Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer\n",
      "There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before\n",

      "11Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own stan -dards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes\n",
      "It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have ex -pended your own powers of adjustment\n",

      "She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented ‘place’ that Broadway had begot -ten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing\n",
      "She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand\n",

Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinite -ly rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one mo -ment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion\n",
      "I stayed late that night\n",
      "Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead\n",

      "Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder\n",
      "His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own\n",
      "He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God\n",
      "So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star\n",

      "Before me stretched the portentous menac -ing road of a new decade\n",
      "It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island\n",
      "Tom talked incessantly, exult -ing and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead\n",
      "Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind\n",
      "Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thin -ning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair\n",
      "But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age\n",
      "As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand\n",
      "So we drove on toward death through the cooling twi -light\n",
      "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint be -side the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest\n",
      "He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over\n",
      "Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson re -fused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did\n",
      "While\n",
      "1his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead\n",
      "‘I’ve got my wife locked in up there,’ explained Wilson calmly\n",
      "‘She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we’re going to move away\n",
      "’Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement\n",
      "Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working he sat on a chair in the door -way and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road\n",
      "When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way\n",
      "He was his wife’s man and not his own\n",
      "So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had hap -pened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days\n",
      "Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later\n",
      "But he didn’t\n",
      "He supposed he forgot to, that’s all\n",
      "When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs\n",
      "Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage\n",
      "‘Beat me!’ he heard her cry\n",
      "‘Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!’A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over\n",
      "\n",
      "1 The ‘death car’ as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend\n",
      "Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color—he told the first po -liceman that it was light green\n",
      "The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust\n",
      "Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath\n",
      "The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long\n",
      "We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away\n",
      "‘Wreck!’ said Tom\n",
      "‘That’s good\n",
      "Wilson’ll have a little business at last\n",
      "’He slowed down, but still without any intention of stop -ping until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes\n",
      "‘We’ll take a look,’ he said doubtfully, ‘just a look\n",
      "’I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which is -sued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved it -self into the words ‘Oh, my God!’ uttered over and over in\n",
      "1a gasping moan\n",
      "‘There’s some bad trouble here,’ said Tom excitedly\n",
      "He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead\n",
      "Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through\n",
      "The circle closed up again with a running murmur of ex -postulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all\n",
      "Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside\n",
      "Myrtle Wilson’s body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless\n",
      "Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book\n",
      "At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, sway -ing back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands\n",
      "Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoul -der, but Wilson neither heard nor saw\n",
      "His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out inces -santly his high horrible call\n",
      "‘O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!’\n",
      "1 Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman\n",
      "‘M-a-v—’ the policeman was saying, ‘—o——‘‘No,—r—’ corrected the man, ‘M-a-v-r-o——‘‘Listen to me!’ muttered Tom fiercely\n",
      "‘r—’ said the policeman, ‘o——‘‘g——‘‘g—’ He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder\n",
      "‘What you want, fella?’‘What happened—that’s what I want to know!’‘Auto hit her\n",
      "Ins’antly killed\n",
      "’‘Instantly killed,’ repeated Tom, staring\n",
      "‘She ran out ina road\n",
      "Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car\n",
      "’‘There was two cars,’ said Michaelis, ‘one comin’, one goin’, see?’‘Going where?’ asked the policeman keenly\n",
      "‘One goin’ each way\n",
      "Well, she—’ His hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side, ‘—she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour\n",
      "’‘What’s the name of this place here?’ demanded the of -ficer\n",
      "‘Hasn’t got any name\n",

      "New\n",

      "I want to get his name\n",
      "’Some words of this conversation must have reached Wil -son swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries\n",
      "‘You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!’Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat\n",
      "He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms\n",
      "‘You’ve got to pull yourself together,’ he said with sooth -ing gruffness\n",
      "Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright\n",
      "‘Listen,’ said Tom, shaking him a little\n",
      "‘I just got here a minute ago, from New York\n",
      "I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about\n",
      "That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine, do you hear? I haven’t seen it all af -ternoon\n",
      "’Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes\n",

      "‘I’m a friend of his\n",
      "’ Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body\n",

      "‘And what color’s your car?’‘It’s a blue car, a coupé\n",
      "’‘We’ve come straight from New York,’ I said\n",
      "Some one who had been driving a little behind us con -firmed this and the policeman turned away\n",
      "‘Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct——‘Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back\n",
      "‘If somebody’ll come here and sit with him!’ he snapped authoritatively\n",
      "He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room\n",
      "Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table\n",
      "As he passed close to me he whispered ‘Let’s get out\n",
      "’Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, pass -ing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago\n",
      "Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard and the coupé raced along through the night\n",
      "In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face\n",
      "‘The God Damn coward!’ he whimpered\n",
      "‘He didn’t even stop his car\n",
      "’The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees\n",

      "1dows bloomed with light among the vines\n",
      "‘Daisy’s home,’ he said\n",
      "As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly\n",
      "‘I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick\n",
      "There’s nothing we can do tonight\n",
      "’A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision\n",
      "As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phras -es\n",
      "‘I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any\n",
      "’ He opened the door\n",
      "‘Come in\n",
      "’‘No thanks\n",

      "’I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone\n",
      "But Jordan lingered for a moment more\n",
      "‘It’s only half past nine,’ she said\n",
      "I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too\n",
      "She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house\n",
      "I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice call -ing a taxi\n",
      "Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate\n",
      "\n",
      "1 I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path\n",
      "I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit un -der the moon\n",
      "‘What are you doing?’ I inquired\n",
      "‘Just standing here, old sport\n",
      "’Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation\n",
      "For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of ‘Wolf -shiem’s people,’ behind him in the dark shrubbery\n",
      "‘Did you see any trouble on the road?’ he asked after a minute\n",
      "‘Yes\n",
      "’He hesitated\n",
      "‘Was she killed?’‘Yes\n",
      "’‘I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so\n",
      "It’s better that the shock should all come at once\n",
      "She stood it pretty well\n",

      "How the devil did it happen?’\n",
      "1‘Well, I tried to swing the wheel——’ He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth\n",
      "‘Was Daisy driving?’‘Yes,’ he said after a moment, ‘but of course I’ll say I was\n",
      "You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way\n",
      "It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew\n",
      "Well, first Daisy turned away from the wom -an toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back\n",
      "The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly\n",
      "’‘It ripped her open——‘‘Don’t tell me, old sport\n",

      "‘Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it\n",
      "I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t so I pulled on the emergency brake\n",
      "Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on\n",
      "‘She’ll be all right tomorrow,’ he said presently\n",
      "‘I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon\n",

      "He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything\n",
      "I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the second floor\n",
      "‘You wait here,’ I said\n",
      "‘I’ll see if there’s any sign of a com -motion\n",
      "’I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps\n",

      "Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window\n",
      "The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill\n",
      "Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale\n",
      "He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own\n",
      "Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement\n",
      "They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either\n",
      "There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together\n",
      "As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house\n",
      "Gatsby was wait -ing where I had left him in the drive\n",

      "‘You’d better come home\n",
      "1and get some sleep\n",

      "‘I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed\n",
      "Good night, old sport\n",
      "’He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil\n",

      "\n",
      "1 I couldn’t sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning in -cessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams\n",
      "Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning would be too late\n",
      "Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep\n",
      "‘Nothing happened,’ he said wanly\n",
      "‘I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light\n",
      "’His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cig -arettes\n",
      "We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano\n",
      "There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn’t been aired for many days\n",
      "I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside\n",
      "Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness\n",

      "He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do\n",
      "He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free\n",
      "It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because ‘Jay Gatsby’ had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out\n",
      "I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy\n",
      "She was the first ‘nice’ girl he had ever known\n",
      "In vari -ous unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between\n",
      "He found her excitingly desirable\n",
      "He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone\n",
      "It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before\n",
      "But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him\n",
      "There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motor cars and of danc -es whose flowers were scarcely withered\n",
      "It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her\n",
      "1 value in his eyes\n",
      "He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions\n",
      "But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident\n",
      "However glorious might be his future as Jay Gats -by, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders\n",
      "So he made the most of his time\n",
      "He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand\n",
      "He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses\n",
      "I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her\n",
      "As a matter of fact he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world\n",
      "But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined\n",
      "He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail\n",
      "He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a ‘nice’ girl could be\n",
      "She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing\n",
      "He felt married to her, that was all\n",
      "When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who\n",
      "10was breathless, who was somehow betrayed\n",
      "Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth\n",
      "She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor\n",
      "‘I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport\n",
      "I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too\n",
      "She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her…\n",
      "Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care\n",
      "What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?’On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time\n",
      "It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed\n",
      "Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair\n",
      "The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised\n",
      "They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep\n",
      "He did extraordinarily well in the war\n",
      "He was a captain\n",
      "11 before he went to the front and following the Argonne bat -tles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns\n",
      "After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead\n",
      "He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters\n",
      "She didn’t see why he couldn’t come\n",
      "She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his pres -ence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all\n",
      "For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes\n",
      "All night the sax -ophones wailed the hopeless comment of the ‘Beale Street Blues’ while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust\n",
      "At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose pet -als blown by the sad horns around the floor\n",
      "Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed\n",
      "And all the time something within her was crying for a decision\n",
      "She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at\n",

      "For a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it\n",

      "About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car\n",
      "He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen\n",

      "He didn’t like to go into the ga -rage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the of -fice—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet\n",

      "But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying ‘Oh, my God!’ again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air\n",
      "‘Then he killed her,’ said Wilson\n",
      "His mouth dropped open suddenly\n",
      "‘Who did?’‘I have a way of finding out\n",

      "It was the man in that car\n",

      "10Mrs\n",
      "Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car\n",
      "‘How could she of been like that?’‘She’s a deep one,’ said Wilson, as if that answered the question\n",
      "‘Ah-h-h——‘He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand\n",
      "‘Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?’This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife\n",
      "He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off\n",
      "About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light\n",
      "Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind\n",
      "‘I spoke to her,’ he muttered, after a long silence\n",
      "‘I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God\n",
      "I took her to the window—’ With an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it, ‘—and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, ev -erything you’ve been doing\n",

      "11 ‘That’s an advertisement,’ Michaelis assured him\n",
      "Some -thing made him turn away from the window and look back into the room\n",
      "But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight\n",
      "By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside\n",
      "It was one of the watch -ers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together\n",
      "Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone\n",
      "His movements—he was on foot all the time—were af -terward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat and a cup of coffee\n",
      "He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon\n",
      "Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man ‘acting sort of crazy’ and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road\n",
      "Then for three hours he disappeared from view\n",
      "The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he ‘had a way of finding out,’ supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car\n",
      "On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward—and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of find -ing out what he wanted to know\n",
      "By half past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house\n",
      "So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name\n",
      "At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left\n",
      "1word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool\n",
      "He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up\n",
      "Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair\n",
      "Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool\n",
      "Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees\n",
      "No telephone message arrived but the butler went with -out his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was any one to give it to if it came\n",
      "I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come and per -haps he no longer cared\n",
      "If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream\n",
      "He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass\n",
      "A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees\n",
      "The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterward he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them\n",
      "I drove from the sta -tion directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously\n",
      "1 up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one\n",
      "But they knew then, I firmly believe\n",
      "With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hur -ried down to the pool\n",
      "There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other\n",
      "With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool\n",
      "A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugat -ed the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden\n",
      "The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water\n",
      "It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete\n",
      "\n",
      "1After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of po -lice and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door\n",
      "A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool\n",
      "Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression ‘mad man’ as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious author -ity of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning\n",
      "Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, cir -cumstantial, eager and untrue\n",
      "When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word\n",
      "She showed a surprising amount of char -acter about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever\n",
      "She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more\n",
      "1 than she could endure\n",
      "So Wilson was reduced to a man ‘deranged by grief’ in order that the case might remain in its simplest form\n",
      "And it rested there\n",
      "But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential\n",
      "I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone\n",
      "From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me\n",
      "At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, be -cause no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end\n",
      "I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation\n",
      "But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them\n",

      "Don’t worry\n",
      "Just trust me and I’ll get some -body for you——‘Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book\n",
      "The butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called\n",
      "1Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone\n",

      "But as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain\n",

      "But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall\n",
      "Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train\n",
      "That request seemed super -fluous when I wrote it\n",
      "I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr\n",
      "Wolfshiem arrived, no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men\n",

      "Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distor -tion\n",
